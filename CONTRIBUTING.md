General guideline to contribute to the project 

## Development Process

We strive to make developing of this Project as frictionless as possible, both for ourselves and for our community. This section 
should get you up and running working on the Project codebase. Before beginning development, you may want to read through our 
overview on [architecture and best practices](./docs/code) to get a better understanding of our overall structure.

### Setting up your development environment

You'll need a recent version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to work on Project. 
We [test our builds](https://travis-ci.com/....) using both the latest and LTS node versions, so use of one of those is recommended. 
You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily install and manage different versions of node on your system.
